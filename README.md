## 🧭 New User Tips
- Click "Continue" in the top-right to resume your last lesson
- Use the theme toggle in the nav to switch light/dark/system
- Manage your progress backup at `/settings` (export/import/reset)
- Search any lesson at `/search`

## 🔐 Data & Storage
- Progress is stored under the namespaced key `learnpy::progress:v1`
- A one-time migration copies legacy `completedCourses` to the new key

## Running Locally
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## How It Works
- Puzzles are defined in `src/lib/puzzles.ts` with:
  - `slug`: route identifier
  - `title`, `description`, `lesson`: content
  - `prompt`, optional `placeholder`, optional `hint`
  - `check(answer)`: returns true for correct, or a string with feedback
- Lesson UI uses `LessonFrame.tsx`:
  - Handles input, Enter-to-submit, feedback UI, and saving progress to `localStorage` via `src/lib/storage.ts`.
  - Provides a “Next Lesson” button using the slug order.
- Top navigation (`Nav.tsx`) displays overall progress (completed/total) with a progress bar.

## Adding/Editing Lessons
1. Edit `src/lib/puzzles.ts` to add a new puzzle object to the `puzzles` array.
2. Include a unique `slug`.
3. `check(answer)` should be a simple predicate returning `true` or a feedback string.
4. The dynamic route `/learn/[slug]` will automatically include the new lesson.

## Notes
- The shadcn/ui components are implemented as minimal in-project primitives for portability. If you want the full shadcn/ui stack, you can integrate it via their CLI and replace these primitives accordingly.
- Progress is stored under a `learnpy::progress` key prefix in `localStorage`.

## Production
Build and start:
```
npm run build
npm start
```
